### A Theme Builder for Directus

> Hey all,
>
> #### What's troublesome
> When I am customizing the directus app with a color, I'm having the issue of going through all the steps of converting a single color to css object [see attachment], as a solution I use the site: https://mdigi.tools/darken-color and their lighten option, this works well but is a bit tedious to do.
> 
> #### My Idea for a solution
> Would it be useful if I would create a tool/webapp which converts a single hex color code to all of the required css object values [see attachment]?
> 
> _**TLDR**: Easier way to apply a custom color with a webapp color converter._
