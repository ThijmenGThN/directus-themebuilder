### A Theme Builder for Directus

> #### Motive
> When I am customizing the directus app with a color, I'm having the issue of going through all the steps of converting a single color to the css object, as a solution I use the site: https://mdigi.tools/darken-color and their lighten option, this works well but is a bit tedious to do.
>
> Hence the reason why I started this project, try it out the link is below.
> 
> _**TLDR**: Easier way to apply a custom color with a webapp color converter._
